# CodeTrybe Community Code of Conduct

At CodeTrybe, we are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. As a contributor, maintainer, or member of our community, we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We believe that diversity is our strength, and we are committed to creating an environment that fosters inclusivity, empathy, and understanding. We are all here to learn and grow together, and we recognize that we each have something unique to contribute.

As members of the CodeTrybe community, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of behavior. We expect all community members to follow these standards, and we will take appropriate action to address any instances of unacceptable behavior.
