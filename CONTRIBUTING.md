# Contributing to Git and Github

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Git and Github!

To make a contribution, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command line or a Git client.

3. Create a new branch for your changes using a descriptive name. This helps us to easily identify the purpose of your changes.

4. Make your changes to the codebase, adhering to any relevant coding standards and guidelines.

5. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce any new issues.

6. Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message that describes the purpose of your changes.

7. Push your changes to your forked repository.

8. Create a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository on GitHub. Your pull request should clearly explain the changes you have made and their purpose.

9. Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request. They may request changes or ask for more information before merging your changes into the main repository.
