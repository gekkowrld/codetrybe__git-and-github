# Git and Github

This is a repository that has the resource files of Git and Github. It is meant for students in ALX SWE course who have access to a `sandbox`. But this can also work if you have a linux machine. Most of the commands are x86_64 architecture Debian/Ubuntu based. But any other *nix system can do it. If you are on Windows, you can use `Git Bash` to follow along.
